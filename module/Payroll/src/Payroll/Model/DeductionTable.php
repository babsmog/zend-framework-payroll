This Table class uses Zend Database TableGateway class to interact with our
database using an entity object. This is an implementation of the Table Data Gateway design pattern to allow for
interfacing with data in a database table. Be aware though that the Table Data Gateway pattern can become limiting in larger systems.
There is also a temptation to put database access code into controller action methods as these are exposed by
Zend\Db\TableGateway\AbstractTableGateway. Donâ€™t do this!
